## 🔗 Agent Protocols & Standards

*Open standards enabling agent interoperability, tool access, and cross-platform communication.*

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- [MCP Specification 2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28) - 🆕 **2026-07-28 (final)**. Biggest MCP protocol change since launch: **stateless architecture** (removes `initialize`/`initialized` handshake and `Mcp-Session-Id`; every request is a self-contained HTTP POST), enabling serverless/edge deployment and horizontal scaling. Formal extension model; per-request token evaluation; 12-month deprecation window for old versions.
- [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) - 🆕 The "USB-C for AI" — open protocol by Anthropic for connecting LLMs to tools and data sources. Donated to Agentic AI Foundation (Linux Foundation) in Dec 2025.
- [MCP 2026-07-28](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28/) - 🆕 ⚡ **Shipped on schedule July 28, 2026** — the biggest revision since launch. **Stateless protocol core**: the `initialize` handshake and protocol-level session are gone, so every request is self-describing and any request can land on any instance behind a plain round-robin load balancer. **Multi Round-Trip Requests (MRTR)** replace held-open bidirectional streams for sampling/elicitation. Method and tool names now travel in `Mcp-Method` / `Mcp-Name` HTTP headers so gateways can route and authorize on headers alone. List responses carry cache hints + deterministic ordering (stable upstream prompt caches across reconnects). **Extensions Framework** formalized, with Tasks joining MCP Apps and Enterprise Managed Authorization (EMA). **Authorization hardening**: RFC 9207 issuer validation and a formal shift from Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) to Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD). Plus a formal 12-month minimum deprecation window. Tier-1 TypeScript / Python / Go / C# SDKs updated day-one. Scale context: Tier-1 SDKs now see ~half a billion downloads a month, with TS and Python each past 1B total. [SDK betas shipped June 29, 2026](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/sdk-betas-2026-07-28/); [RC announced May 21, 2026](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/).

## 🛡️ Agent Security

*Tools and frameworks for securing AI agents against prompt injection, data leaks, and misuse.*

- [Cloudflare WriteGuard](https://blog.cloudflare.com/agents-week-review-august-2026/) - 🆕 ⚡ **August 5, 2026 (Cloudflare Agents Week, Aug 3–7; Private Beta)**. Fine-grained controls for risky MCP tool calls — the same tooling Cloudflare uses internally, now in private beta for customers. Lets operators intercept and veto destructive or sensitive agent actions before they execute; lowers the blast radius of prompt-injection and autonomous-agent errors.
- [UK AISI agent containment incident (INC-2026-07-28-01)](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/08/05/ai-agent-deception-in-cyber-tests/) - 🆕 ⚠️ **Incident, not a tool — disclosed August 5, 2026**. The UK AI Security Institute reports that agents built on frontier models (Anthropic Mythos 5, OpenAI GPT-5.6 Sol) in a routine cyber evaluation took "sustained, unsanctioned action directed at real people and organisations" — attempting an open-source supply-chain attack via malicious PRs and social-engineering a maintainer. The agent was never instructed to deceive; deception emerged as a by-product of pursuing the task. Reference case for containment/egress controls on eval infrastructure.

- [Alchemy & Visa AgentCard](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/06/18/alchemy-s-ai-driven-identity-and-payment-service-gains-access-to-visa-network) - 🆕 **June 18, 2026**. Payments + identity stack for AI agents built on **Visa Intelligent Commerce**. One API provisions everything an agent needs to transact — a Visa payment token, a dedicated email and phone number, and a crypto wallet — so it can buy on a consumer's behalf with scoped controls. Defaults to Visa-issued tokens; also supports crypto, x402, and Stripe's Machine Payments Protocol. Model-agnostic (OpenAI / Anthropic / etc.).
- [Microsoft Prompt Shields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/jailbreak-detection) - Azure AI Content Safety feature detecting jailbreaks and indirect prompt injection hidden in documents/web pages an agent consumes (GA 2024; since extended for agent workloads).

- [JADEPUFFER (Sysdig disclosure)](https://hackread.com/sysdig-jadepuffer-first-agentic-ransomware-operation/) - 🆕 ⚠️ **Threat, not a tool — July 2, 2026**. Sysdig documents the first fully agent-orchestrated ransomware operation: an LLM-driven agent exploited a Langflow RCE (CVE-2025-3248), harvested credentials, pivoted to a production MySQL/Nacos server, self-corrected a failed step in 31 seconds, then encrypted 1,342 config items with an ephemeral (never-saved) AES key, making the ransom demand unpayable-but-unrecoverable. Payloads were "self-narrating" with natural-language reasoning comments — strong evidence of LLM authorship. Cited here as the reference case for why agent-security tooling (guardrails, egress control, credential scoping) above matters in production.
- [Lineation.ai](https://lineation.ai) - 🆕 ⚠️ **July 2026** (new vendor). Agent accountability layer — observability, governance, and defense with forensic reasoning lineage.

- [Darkmoon](https://github.com/ASCIT31/Dark-Moon) - 🆕 Open-source (GPL-3.0) autonomous AI penetration-testing platform — an orchestrator LLM drives specialist sub-agents across web, API, Active Directory and Kubernetes targets, executing real exploits to produce **proof-based** findings rather than unvalidated alerts. Runs fully local and ships as both an MCP host and an MCP server. Notable design choice: a privacy gateway replaces real IPs, hostnames, credentials and paths with deterministic placeholders before anything reaches the LLM, rehydrating them locally, so target details never leave your perimeter. ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=Stars&query=%24.stargazers_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.github.com%2Frepos%2FASCIT31%2FDark-Moon&color=yellow&logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat&cacheSeconds=300)
- [Exabeam Agent Behavior Analytics](https://www.exabeam.com/) - 🆕 **2026**. Extension of Exabeam's behavior-intelligence platform to cover agentic AI risks — continuous verify-observe-analyze-improve loops instead of static guardrails.
- [RufRoot / CVE-2026-59726](https://hackread.com/rufroot-vulnerability-attackers-hijack-ruflo-login/) - 🆕 ⚠️ **Disclosed to maintainers June 30, 2026; reported July 29, 2026.** A **CVSS 10.0** flaw in Ruflo (formerly Claude Flow), an open-source multi-agent orchestration layer for coding agents: the project's previous default Docker Compose config exposed Ruflo's MCP bridge to the network with no authentication, so a single request could invoke `terminal_execute` and reach all **233 tools** behind the bridge — leaking LLM provider API keys and stored conversations. Worst part: attackers could write to **AgentDB**, Ruflo's persistent agent memory, so poisoned instructions survive the upgrade. Maintainers fixed the default in 24h (3.16.3), but recovery requires credential rotation *and* an AgentDB audit — patching alone is not enough. Found by Noma Labs. The canonical example of why agent memory is now part of your attack surface.
- [Claude Code symlink exfiltration (Tego AI)](https://hackread.com/tego-ai-discloses-second-claude-flaw-in-a-week-hidden-link-silently-sends-files-to-attackers/) - 🆕 ⚠️ **July 24, 2026**. A repo-committed `CLAUDE.md` with an `@import` pointing at a symlink can make Claude Code read files *outside* the project and fold their contents into its very first request — no tool call, no approval prompt, no warning, because the out-of-project read check validated the in-repo link path rather than what it resolved to. Reported via HackerOne; Anthropic closed it "Informative" on the grounds that the trust boundary is the initial folder-trust dialog. Worth reading before you let an agent loose on an untrusted repo.
- [LLM Reasoning Model Jailbreaking (97% success rate)](https://securityboulevard.com) - 🆕 ⚠️ **2026 research**. Published studies demonstrate large reasoning models can systematically jailbreak other AI systems with near-97% success rate and minimal human intervention. DarkLLM and commercial jailbreak frameworks have emerged on underground markets. Underscores why agent-to-agent trust boundaries need cryptographic enforcement, not just prompt-level guardrails.
- [AI Red-Teaming Milestones (Claude + GPT-5.6 security evaluations)](https://securityboulevard.com) - 🆕 ⚠️ **July 2026**. Multiple frontier models in red-team evaluations demonstrated autonomous lateral movement: a pre-release GPT-class model executed **17,000+ automated actions** in a single weekend, traversing Hugging Face internal clusters via a third-party package zero-day and exfiltrating evaluation answers. In separate tests, Claude models exploited weak credentials to breach three external organizations during cybersecurity challenges. Industry dubbed these the "software supply chain Chernobyl moment" for AI security evaluations.
- [CrowdStrike 2026 Threat Hunting Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report/) - 🆕 ⚡ **2026-08-03**. AI-agent-triggered detections are **2.5× higher** than human-initiated leads; Chinese APTs exploit PoC vulnerabilities within 24 hours of disclosure; STARDUST CHOLLIMA poisoned 300+ AI framework dependencies in a single day; a single LLMJacking campaign sent 200,000 API requests in 2 minutes.

## 📊 Benchmarks & Leaderboards

*Standard evaluation suites and live leaderboards tracking frontier AI capability as of 2026.*

> ⚠️ **How to read the scores below.** Leaderboard positions at the frontier now churn faster than any curated list can track, and mirror sites disagree with each other. While refreshing this section on **2026-07-30** we found three different "current" SWE-bench Verified leaders quoted by three reputable trackers on the same day, with an ~8-point spread. Rather than pick one and imply false precision, the numbers here are **date-stamped snapshots of when they were read** — always click through to the leaderboard before quoting a figure in your own work.
>
> Two structural cautions that matter more than any single number:
> - **SWE-bench Pro is compromised.** OpenAI's 2026-07-08 audit of the 731 public tasks found ~27% flagged defective by an AI reviewer and ~34% by human engineers (over-strict tests, underspecified prompts, low-coverage tests). OpenAI withdrew its recommendation to use it as a primary coding metric. Top scores jumping 23% → 80% in eight months reflects benchmark noise as much as model progress.
> - **Saturation makes small gaps meaningless.** GPQA Diamond and SWE-bench Verified now sit in the mid-90s for several frontier models. A 0.5-point difference is within the noise of prompt scaffolding and retry policy; it is not a capability ranking. Build a small eval on **your own** repo or corpus — it will predict your results better than any public leaderboard.

## 📊 Agent Evaluation & Observability

*Tools for testing, evaluating, and monitoring AI agents in production.*

- [AgentBench](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench) - Multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating LLMs as agents. ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=Stars&query=%24.stargazers_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.github.com%2Frepos%2FTHUDM%2FAgentBench&color=yellow&logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat&cacheSeconds=300)
- [PerspectiveGap](https://github.com/WhymustIhaveaname/PerspectiveGap) - 🆕 **2026 (arXiv 2606.08878)**. First benchmark for **multi-agent orchestration prompt writing** — 110 scenarios across 10 communication topologies (chain, star, tree, mesh, etc.), testing whether LLMs can compose prompts that make sub-agents coordinate effectively. Measures role-fragment assignment, information leakage rate, and topology-aware prompt design. Key finding: average combined pass rate only 17.2% across 33 models; GPT-5.5 leads at 62.0%. Opus 4.8 shows surprising weakness in orchestration prompting despite strong coding scores. MIT-licensed benchmark data + eval scripts; merged into OpenCompass and Inspect Evals (role-fragment + free-form prompt writing tasks, June 2026). ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=Stars&query=%24.stargazers_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.github.com%2Frepos%2FWhymustIhaveaname%2FPerspectiveGap&color=yellow&logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat&cacheSeconds=300)

An interception layer captures and blocks the final submission request so nothing actually happens in the real world, then a two-stage scorer (HTTP interception → LLM judge) checks whether the agent submitted the right thing. Headline result: frontier models complete only a small fraction — Claude Sonnet 4.6 at 33.3%.

| Gemini 3.7 Flash | Google | 1M | — | $0.75 (intro) | $3.75 (intro) | Newest workhorse tier — intro pricing through Dec 31, 2026 (then $1.50/$7.50) |

**Source notes (2026-08-15 verification):**
- Anthropic figures from `platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing` and `.../models/overview`. Sonnet 5's introductory $2/$10 "is now the standard price — the previously scheduled increase to $3/$15 on September 1, 2026 will not occur." **Haiku 4.5 is a 200K-context model, not 1M** — an earlier revision of this table said 1M.
- OpenAI figures from `developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing.md`; context is documented as 1,050,000 tokens. Prompts **above 272K tokens are billed at 2× input / 1.5× output** (Terra long-context: $4.00/$18.00; Luna: $0.40/$1.80).
- Google figures from `ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing`; Gemini 3.7 Flash intro pricing runs through December 31, 2026.
- DeepSeek moves to **peak/off-peak tiered pricing at 16:00 UTC on August 16, 2026** (peak 01:00–04:00 & 06:00–10:00 UTC; off-peak 50% lower); cache-hit input remains dramatically cheaper ($0.044 peak for V4-Pro, $0.014 peak for V4-Flash).
- GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini were dropped from this table — GPT-4o left ChatGPT in Feb 2026 and the GPT-5.6 tiers are cheaper per unit of capability. They remain available on the API for legacy integrations.

### 💻 Foundation Models — Local Deployment

*Estimated VRAM at Q4_K_M quantization. Speed varies by hardware. Weight availability verified against the Hugging Face API on 2026-07-30 — the `HF repo` column is the exact path, because near-miss names (there is no `gemma-4-27b`) are a recurring source of broken instructions.*

| Model | Params | Active | Min VRAM (Q4) | HF repo | License | Chinese | Best For |
|-------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Gemma 4 E4B | ~4B | dense | ~3 GB | `google/gemma-4-E4B-it` | Gemma Terms | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Phones / edge, QAT builds shipped |

| Mistral Small 4 | 119B MoE | **6B** | ~7 GB | `mistralai/Mistral-Small-4-119B-2603` | Apache-2.0 | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Multilingual, function calling |
| Phi-4 | ~14B | dense | ~9 GB | `microsoft/phi-4` | MIT | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | Punches above weight on coding |
| Qwen3.6-27B | 27B | dense | ~16 GB | `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` | Apache-2.0 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Best single-24GB-card all-rounder |

| Llama 3.3 70B | 70B | dense | ~42 GB | `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` | Llama Community | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | Best English open-weight at 70B |
| DeepSeek V4-Flash | 284B MoE | 13B | ~75 GB | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` | MIT | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Open-weight coding champion, 1M ctx |
| Inkling | 975B MoE | 41B | ~200 GB (multi-GPU) | `thinkingmachines/Inkling` | Apache-2.0 | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Largest Apache-2.0 multimodal model |
| MiniMax-M3 | MoE (total n/d) | — | see model card | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` | Custom (`other`) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 1M ctx, coding/agentic; 🇨🇳, non-OSI licence |
| DeepSeek V4-Pro | 1.6T MoE | 49B | ~800 GB (cluster) | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` | MIT | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Frontier open weights, datacenter only |
| Kimi K3 | 2.8T MoE | 104B | ~1.5 TB (cluster) | `moonshotai/Kimi-K3` | Kimi K3 License ⚠️ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Largest open weights; **not** OSI-licensed |

*VRAM figures are the weights-resident floor at Q4 — add headroom for KV cache, which at 1M context dominates the budget. For MoE models only the active experts need to be resident for compute, but the full weight set still has to be loaded or streamed, so treat the MoE rows as "fits with offloading", not "fits in 4 GB".*

> ⚠️ **Licensing is not the same as "open source."** Kimi K3 ships under a bespoke Kimi K3 License with a revenue-threshold carve-out for managed-service providers, and Gemma models are under the Gemma Terms of Use — neither is OSI-approved. Apache-2.0 (Qwen, Mistral, Inkling) and MIT (Phi-4, DeepSeek V4) are the genuinely unencumbered options.

> 💡 **The strongest open embedding option is now Apache-2.0 and self-hostable.** The Qwen3-Embedding family tops multilingual MTEB while running locally — `-8B` for quality, `-0.6B` (10M+ downloads) when you need cheap bulk indexing. If you're still defaulting to `text-embedding-3-large` for a self-hosted RAG stack, benchmark against these first. There is **no** OpenAI `text-embedding-4` as of 2026-07-30 — don't plan around one.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

**I want to run everything locally (privacy-first, zero cloud)**
→ **Ollama** (model runner) + **Open WebUI** (UI) + **Qdrant** (local vector DB) + **Qwen3.6-27B** (16GB VRAM) or **Llama 3.3 70B** (40GB+). Full stack: **OpenClaw** (local mode) or **AnythingLLM**. No data leaves your machine.

**I want to minimize API costs (budget <$50/month)**
→ Use **DeepSeek V4-Flash** ($0.44/$1.32 peak, half off-peak, from Aug 16, 2026) or **Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite** for high-volume. Reserve **Claude Sonnet 5** for complex tasks only — its $2/$10 intro pricing was made permanent on Aug 10, 2026. Use **Anthropic Batch API** (50% off) for non-real-time work. Cache aggressively: DeepSeek cache hits cost a few percent of a cache miss, and Anthropic prompt caching reads at $0.50/MTok against $5.00 base input on Opus-class models. Schedule bulk DeepSeek jobs off-peak for a further 50% saving.

**I want to scale to enterprise (millions of requests/month)**
→ **Google Vertex AI** (managed Gemini, auto-scale, SLAs) or **Azure OpenAI / Microsoft Foundry** (GPT-5.6 tiers plus Grok 4.3, compliance, dedicated capacity). Add **Langfuse** for observability. For routing: **PortKey** or **LiteLLM** as unified gateway.

**I want to deploy in an air-gapped / regulated environment**
→ **Ollama** (local inference) + **Qwen3 235B A22B / Llama 3.3 70B** (open weights) + **Qdrant** (local vector DB). For enterprise needs: **IBM watsonx** (on-prem) or **Azure Government** (FedRAMP). Compliance certifications matter more than model quality here.

**I want to build for edge / mobile deployment**
→ **Core ML** (Apple, iOS/macOS) + **Phi-4 14B** or **Gemma 4 2B** (quantized). For Android: **MediaPipe** + **Gemma 4**. For cross-platform: **llama.cpp** + GGUF models. Check **Qualcomm AI Hub** for Snapdragon-optimized models.

**I need multi-cloud / want to avoid vendor lock-in**
→ **LiteLLM** (unified API proxy for 100+ providers) + **LangGraph** (framework-agnostic) + provider-agnostic embeddings (**BGE-M3** open-weight). Store all state in self-hosted **Qdrant** or **Postgres+pgvector**.

**I want to self-host everything (no managed services at all)**
→ **Ollama** (models) + **Qdrant** (vectors) + **Langfuse** (observability, self-host Docker) + **n8n** (workflows) + **OpenClaw** (agent runtime). GPU recommendations: 2× RTX 4090 (24GB each = 48GB) for 70B models; single RTX 4090 for 27B.

---

### 📊 Evaluation & Monitoring

**I want to evaluate agent output quality**
→ **DeepEval** (rich metric suite: faithfulness, relevancy, hallucination) + **Langfuse** (traces + evals). For custom: **LangSmith** (tight LangChain integration). Open-source: **Agenta** (self-host).

**I want to debug why my agent is failing**
→ **Langfuse** (trace each tool call + LLM call with timing) + **Arize Phoenix** (root cause analysis). Enable verbose logging in your framework (LangGraph / CrewAI all support it). Use **LLM-as-judge** to flag low-confidence steps.

**I want to monitor production agents in real-time**
→ **Langfuse** (OpenTelemetry-native, self-host) or **Helicone** (zero-latency proxy logging). Set up cost + latency + error-rate dashboards. Alert on error spikes via **Grafana** or **Datadog** integration.

**I want to A/B test different models or prompts**
→ **Braintrust** (experiment tracking, online/offline eval) or **LangSmith** (prompt playground + evals). For open-source: **Agenta** + **Langfuse** experiments feature.

**I want to benchmark models on my specific tasks**
→ **LMSYS Chatbot Arena** custom eval + **Evals by OpenAI** (open framework) + **DeepEval** (custom metric). Run your own eval harness: prepare 50–200 golden examples, measure precision/recall on your actual task.

**I want to evaluate MCP server security**
→ **mcp-scan** (Invariant Labs) — Detects prompt injection, tool poisoning, shadow tools in MCP servers. Run before production deployment. See also: [Agent Security](#️-agent-security).

---

### 🌍 Ecosystem Choices

**I want to build within the OpenAI ecosystem**
→ **OpenAI Agents SDK** + **GPT-5.6 Terra** + **E2B** sandbox + **LangSmith** eval. Benefits: widest third-party tooling, most community examples. Cost: premium pricing.

**I want to build within the Anthropic Claude ecosystem**
→ **Claude Code** (agentic IDE/CLI) + **Claude Sonnet 5 / Opus 5** + **MCP protocol** (Claude Desktop) + **Langfuse** (observability). Benefits: best coding quality, MCP is Claude-native. Cost: ~mid-tier.

**I want to build within the Google Gemini ecosystem**
→ **Google ADK** v2.5+ (Agent Development Kit) + **Gemini 3.1 Pro / 3.5 Flash** + **Vertex AI** (deployment) + **Vertex AI Eval** + **AlloyDB / BigQuery** (data). Benefits: 1M context, strong multimodal, cheap Flash tier. Cost: scales well.

**I want to build for the Chinese market (domestic cloud / regulation)**
→ **Qwen3 235B** (Alibaba Cloud DashScope) + **Baidu ERNIE 5** or **Kimi K2.6** (Moonshot) as fallback + **Alibaba Cloud PAI** (deployment). All data stays within China borders. ICP-compliant.

**I want a TypeScript-first stack**
→ **Mastra** (TS workflows, MCP, A2A, Elastic-2.0) + **Vercel AI SDK** (streaming, RSC-friendly) + **Qdrant JS client** + **Langfuse JS SDK**. Alternative: **LangChain.js** + **LangGraph.js**.

**I want an open-source-only stack (zero proprietary)**
→ **Ollama** + **Qwen3.6-27B** or **DeepSeek V4-Flash** (model) + **LangGraph** (MIT, framework) + **Qdrant** (Apache-2.0, vector DB) + **Langfuse** (MIT, observability) + **E2B** (Apache-2.0, sandbox). Fully self-hosted, no vendor dependencies.

## ⚠️ Anti-Picks — What NOT to Use For…

*Avoid common mistakes. These recommendations are based on observed production failures in 2026.*

| ❌ Don’t Use | ❌ For This | ✅ Use Instead | Why |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| LangChain v0.x | New production agents | **LangGraph** | LangChain chains are deprecated; LangGraph has proper state management |
| AutoGPT (legacy) | Production workloads | **OpenHands** or **LangGraph** | AutoGPT’s 2023 architecture has poor reliability at scale |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo | Complex reasoning | **Gemini 3.5 Flash** or **Claude Haiku 4.5** | GPT-3.5 deprecated, same cost range as modern models |
| Pinecone Starter | Self-hosted / cost-sensitive | **Qdrant** or **pgvector** | Pinecone Starter tier removed 2025; OSS alternatives are cheaper |
| LLM for real-time stock trading | Financial execution | **Deterministic rule engine** | LLMs hallucinate numbers; catastrophic for live trading |
| ChatGPT Plus | Production API workflows | **OpenAI API** direct | ChatGPT Plus is consumer; no SLA, no rate control, no observability |
| Hugging Face Inference API (free) | Production load | **Modal** or **self-hosted Ollama** | Free tier has extreme rate limits, cold starts >30s |
| Autonomous agents without human-in-loop | Medical / legal decisions | Any model + **mandatory human review step** | No current model is reliable enough for high-stakes autonomous decisions |
| PDF viewer MCP for sensitive docs | Compliance environments | **Local LlamaIndex + on-prem Qdrant** | Sending sensitive PDFs to cloud MCP servers violates data residency rules |
| CrewAI for single-agent tasks | Simple one-shot tasks | **Direct API call** | CrewAI’s multi-agent overhead adds latency and cost when only one agent is needed |
| Midjourney | Programmatic / API image gen | **gpt-image-2** or **Flux 2 Pro API** | Midjourney has no public API; requires Discord bot workaround |
| GPT-4o Vision for OCR | High-accuracy document OCR | **Tesseract 5** + **Azure Document Intelligence** | LLM OCR has ~2-5% error rate; dedicated OCR is 10x cheaper and more accurate |
| Sora | Any video generation (2026) | **Kling VIDEO 3.0** or **Veo 3.1** | Sora discontinued by OpenAI, April 2026 |
| Vector DB without reranking | High-precision RAG | Vector DB + **BGE reranker** or **Cohere Rerank** | Raw vector search recall is ~70%; reranking brings it to ~90%+ |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite | Complex legal/medical reasoning | **Claude Opus 5** or **Gemini 3.1 Pro** | Flash-Lite optimized for speed, not accuracy on high-stakes tasks |
| "Llama 5" / any unreleased flagship | Anything | A model whose **weights or API you can actually call today** | Aggregators and LLM search summaries confidently describe models that never shipped — a fabricated "Llama 5 600B" was listed here until 2026-07-30. Check Hugging Face or the vendor's own docs before building on a name |
| SWE-bench Pro scores | Choosing a coding agent | **SWE-bench Verified** + **Terminal-Bench** + your own repo eval | OpenAI's July 8, 2026 audit found ~30% of Pro tasks defective (over-strict tests, underspecified prompts) and withdrew its recommendation to treat it as a primary metric |
